        Netlify provides deploy previews, allowing you to see how your changes will look before they are publicly available.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Overages</span><br><br>
        If you exceed your bandwidth or deployment minuetes, you will be charged extra. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Account suspension</span><br><br>
        For all metered features, if you reach 100% of the limit, new builds will be disabled and all sites on your account will be suspended. You will need to get a paid plan to restore the account and your sites.

      <h3>.Vercel</h3>
      <h3>What is Vercel?</h3>
      <p>
        Vercel is a cloud platform that simplifies the deployment and hosting of web applications, especially frontend and serverless applications. 
      </p>
      <h4>Advantages of Vercel</h4>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Fast and easy deployment</span><br><br>
        Vercel's deployment process is designed to be fast, intuitive, and hassle-free.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Edge network for performance</span><br><br>
        Vercel uses a global edge network to serve content closer to users, reducing latency and improving load times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Serverless function</span><br><br>
        Vercel also allows developers to run backend code without managing servers.
      </p>
      <h4>Disadvantages of Vercel</h4>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Limited backend capabilities</span><br><br>
        Vercel is primarily optimized for frontend development and serverless functions. For complex backend needs (e.g., databases, long-running processes.) you may need to rely on additional services, which can complicate the architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Cost of scaling</span><br><br>
        While Versel offers a free tier, costs can escalate quickly for high-traffic sites or resource-intensive applications. Serverless functions edgen network usage, and bandwidth can become expensive as your project grows.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Vendor Lock-in</span><br><br>
        Vercel's tight integration with it's own echosystem (e.g., Next.Js) and proprietary features can make it harder to migrate to other platforms if needed. This can limit flexibility for some projects.
      </p>
      <h3>.Fire Base</h3>

      <p>
        Fire base is a  cloud-based platform from google that simplifies mobile and web app development by providing a suit of services for backend functionality, allowing developers to to focus on building user experiences rather than infrastructure.

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Faster app development</span><br><br>

        Firebase's closed architecture restricts developers from controlling the platform.<br>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Complex billing Estimation</span><br><br>

        The free plan offers only the basic features which lacks the advanced functions that simpify development tasks.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Not Available Globally</span><br><br>
        Since Firebase is an official Google product with it's URL  taking a google subdomain, i.e, firebase.google.com, the service is blocked in china and countries that has blocked google services.
      </p><br><br>
      <h3>Hosting Platforms I Have Used</h3>
      <p>
        I have tried out two out of these four hosting platforms, which are:
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub</li>
                &
          <li>Netlify</li>
        </ul><br> 

        And i recommend <span style="font-weight: 700;">Netlify</span> for beginners only!!<br><br>
        The reason is because Netlify is very very easy to use for beginners, very straight forward, you can use your email to sign in and you can also link your GitHub account. Plus i'm also a beginner, and i'm still figuring out what works for me, or let me say, what i can use without stress.<br><br>
        When i was to deploy a website for the first time, i used GitHub, and GitHub gave me alot of issues. I had to replace the name of my html file to "index.html". Because if  your html file is note named that way, GitHub won't recognise it.<br><br>
        I then went further into my research about free hosting websites and i found Netlify. I Signed in, which i'll be showing you how in a few minuetes, after my registration i uploaded my files, the same files i uploaded on GitHub that was giving me issues, and in less than 30 seconds, my site was uploaded.<br><br>
        So since that day, i have been using Netlify to deploy my projects.
      </p>
      <h4>How To Host Websites Or Web Apps Using Netlify</h4>
      <p>

      </p>
      <img src="load.jpg" alt="loading image"><br><br>
      <P>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">9. Wait for till it's live</span><br><br>
       The amount of time to wait depends on your internet connection, and the size of your files, 
      </P>
      <img src="wait.jpg" alt="wait image"><br><br>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">10. You have successfully deployed your prioject. </span><br><br>
