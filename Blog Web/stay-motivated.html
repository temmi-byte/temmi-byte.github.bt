            <p>
                Balancing school life with creativity and tech isn't easy. Especially when you're bulding from scratch. <br>
                As a student, developer, and a creative with big dreams and limited resources, there are days when i feel unstoppable, and being energertic to grind... and other days i just want to give up.<br><br>
                But over time, i've learned how to keep showing up for myself, for my growth, and for the the future i believe in. In this post, i want to share how i stay motivated, even when things get tough, and hopefully remind you that you're not alone in this journey.

                <span style="font-weight: 700;">The Struggles I Face</span><br><br>
                Being a student alone comes with alot of pressures, assignments, test, deadlines, money.... Now add beign a developer and a creative into the mix.<br><br>
                There are days i want to learn something new, improve my tech skills, or create content, but school stress and limited resources hold me back. I don't have fancy gadgets yet or access to a good laptop. Most of my work happens on borrowed devices or low-performance ones. <br><br>
                It gets frustraiting when ideas are in your head, but you can't express them the way you want. The pressure of doing school work, especially the money aspect because my school is not after helping students learn, they are after our hard-earned money. It's frustrating when I try to contribute money to buy a few gadgets and that school will threathen us to pay the money that is even more than the money I'm aiming to contribute. In all these, I still push my creativity and tech dreams and that can be overwhelming.

                <span style="font-weight: 700;">What Keeps Me Going</span><br><br>
                In the middle of the struggles, a few things have kept me grounded and moving forward.<br><br>
                First is <span style="font-weight: 700;">vision</span>: the picture of where I know I'm going. I may not have all i need now, but I know I'm made for more. That alone gives me a reason to wake up and keep trying.<br><br>
                Also, little moments like someone complimenting my work saying, "Bro, you inspired me," or "I want to be like you, come and teach me how you did this!" can spark fire in me. I remember why I started.<br><br>
                I also <span style="font-weight: 700;">track my growth.</span> Looking back to when I knew nothing about tech and media, or when I used to give excuses about not having right set of equipments to create content, and seeing how far I've come, that motivates me. Beacuse even small wins count.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">My Motivation Habits</span><br><br>
               Motivation isn't something I always feel, so I've learned to build habits that keeps me going even when the fire isn't there.<br><br>
               One of the things that help me is creating a simple routine. I set time aside weekly to learn something, write, design, or create content and it keeps me aligned.<br><br>
               I also feed my mind with <span style="font-weight: 700;"> inspiring content.</span> <br>
               Sometimes it's a podcast, YouTube video, instagram reel, or a powerful quote I save and revisit, Sometimes i download them if possible. Because the eyes is the gate to the soul, your news feed should align with your purpose. There is a reason why it is called "feed". When i feel drained, i remind myself of why i started by watching or reading stories of poeple who started small and made it.<br><br>
               Lastly, I try to stay connected to people and spaces that inspire growth, even if it's just online. Following people doing great things in tech, creativity, and faith makes me believe it's possible for me too.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">Faith & Inner Drive</span><br><br>
                In a world full of noise, distractions, and pressure to always be ahead, faith is what keeps me grounded. It's not just about religion, it's about knowing that ther's greater purpose to my journey, even when steps aren't clear.<br><br>
                As a student, creative and developer, there are days when I feel stuck, confused, or overwhelmed.<br>
                But faith reminds me that my gifts weren't random. They were planted in me with intention. That's where my inner drive is born, from beliving that I'm not doing this alone.<br><br>
                Faith is what fuels my consistency when motivation fades. It teaches me patience, helps me trust the process, and gives me strenght to keep going, even when results don't show immediately.<br><br>
                This inner drive isn't loud. It's steady. It's a quiet fire thata burns in the background, reminding me that I'm made for more. Every line of code I write, every photos I take, every videos I make, and every post I share isn't just work. It's purpose.<br><br>
                "I don't move by sight, I move by vision, and that vision is powered by faith." You can turn this also to your confessions when you're tired.

            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700;">Staying Consistent Even When It's Hard</span><br><br>
                Consistency isn't about doing everything perfectly, it's about showing up, even on the days you don't feel like it. And trust me, I've had plenty of those days.<br><br>
                There are times i feel stuck or like my efforts aren't making any impact. But instead of quitting, I've learned to take breaks and reset without completely walking away.<br><br>
                And if you think there's a way you can do it that you won't experiencing burn out, I'm here to tell you that you will definetly experience burn out. Sometimes i switch things up, if coding gets too overwhelming, i switch to design or photography. That way, I stay active without burning out.<br><br>
                I also allow myself to feel what I feel, but I don't stay there. I remind myself "Even small steps forward still count". Progress doesn't always have to be fast; it just has to be real.
            </p><br><br><br>
            
           <p>
                If you're a student and a creative or a developer like me, just know this: You're not alone!<br>
                It's okay to feel tired, stuck, or unsure. But don't give up!<br><br>
                You might not have everything you need now, but that doesn't mean you can't start. Use what you have, keep learning, stay connected to your source (God), and trust the process.<br><br>
                Every step you take, they're all building something bigger than you see right now.<br><br>
                Keep going. You were made for this! Don't move by sight, move by vision, and let faith power your vision.
